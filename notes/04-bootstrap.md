<!-- put in head -->
if you want your style, you can put it below bootstrap link... to make style.css important..
<!-- rows are display flex -->
<!-- colums are display block -->
components are html thats been build out
bs5-$=== template that inculdes bootstarp to it
<!-- if you dont have it link bootstrap link -->
<!-- link style below bootstrap it -->
bootstrap gives you class for platte "bg-primary or bg-dark or bg-secondary, bg-warning bg-succsess, bg-info, bg-danger"
<!-- in html -->
if button comfrims then "success'
danger button deleting accotunt would be bg-danger

<!-- bootstrap changes font -->
if you want no padding then 0, padding only works with whole numbers

container is used for thier flex grid system
add a section.

you drop columns into your rows
coulnns go left and right inside rows
container contains rows
rows contain columns
and columns contain content

a container can contain mulitple rows
rows can contain mulitpe coulms
<!-- rows cant rows -->
<!-- columns cant columns -->
container-fluid takes you to the edge
<!-- dont put a column in a container.. -->
<!-- columns in row share the entirety of the row space -->
column has size from 1-12
coulm 12 would take entire wd=idth of row no space for row
col= coulmn
<!-- each row has 12 selections of space -->
<!-- 1 col worth of space = next to each other -->
you dont have to use all 12 sections of a colum to use rows.
<!-- just col would share space evenly. -->
size = take up size they need to take up
change col would change the size from 1-10
to center uo a paragraph.. "jusftify-content-center" if you have d-flex area
<!-- "text-center"  -->
<!-- "fw-bold" change to bold -->
<!-- no css, in html...using bootstrap.. -->
"debug" drop a style tag internal css in html. adds outline, to rows, coulmns and container
depended body... add class to body and call it "debug"
lower spacing would add more space
justify content evenly would make coulmns evenly 
<!-- in html -->
<!-- combine css and style a page in html. -->

debug would help you see how the website should be then without debug you see how it actaully is
