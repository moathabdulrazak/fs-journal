# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I believe that this week went super well, I have more of an understanding on the importance of styling and how to actually style correctly.
I found it shocking that websites are made of rows and columns, it makes it easier for me to visualize how the website should be made. 
I feel like i'm struggling with understanding all the functions of bootstrap, but flex-frog and the d-flex tool in the dev tools have been super helpful. I believe in time, i'll have more of an understanding with all the functions..
I feel super proud of where my first checkpoint is standing at, I was extremely worried about failing it, but when i started the project the more i coded the better it got which motivates to try to make it look the best it can look. I feel happy with the knowledge I have gained so far, It feels like I can actually make a decent looking website without much reference.
