- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?



This week went very well, at first of the week I was extremely lost but on wednesday, It clicked with me. I just didn't fully understand the mvc pattern. I had some help and the way they explained it to me just made sense. I've so far loved every project we made this week. Espcially gregslist. I just was amazed that I actaully added to it and it was working. Overall, this week has been a success!
