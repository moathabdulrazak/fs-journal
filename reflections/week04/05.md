- What would you count as a victory?



Honestly, I believe this week went well. Im still struggling with actaully knowing what type of data im trying to grab but once after I figure that part out, it's nonstop progress which makes me feel good. Ive noticed this pattern that I always seem to be in: when I start the project, I just get super lost, on how to start it, so I ask for help and then once im set in a certian direction, I can manage building the project. I want to get out of that pattern, it makes me feel like im a little bit dumb... Overall this week went great, I had a rough start with this checkpoint espically dealing with the pressaure of it being worth 2 strikes.. but I managed to pull through and complete it. I love the amount of refernce I have, it comes to be extermley helpful when Im feeling stuck(espically during this week, since I was alone).
