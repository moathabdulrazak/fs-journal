# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?




this week went all, I am very happy that we didn't have a checkpoint this week. The hackathon was super fun, I loved working in a team connecting with others and fully planning the project. I feel like, I didn't struggle much with understanding node, I understand all the http requests and how to use virtuals to an extend. overall this week was great!
