Working hard in capestones, with my group. Almost figuring out firebase which would've been a huge accomplishment but couldn't manage to figure it out. We have finished the mvp which is good. I wish if we got more time work on it but sadly everyone was kind of busy during the break overall it went well working on the capestones.
