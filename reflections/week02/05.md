# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I feel like I have a better understanding about javascript, and how it ties in with html and css. I don't feel as confident in my js abilites just yet, im struggling with understanding how to make the functions work properly, Currently working on the checkpoint and reailzing that, I have one more function left and if i dont figure it out itll make me fail the checkpoint, Making it harder to complete the objective, I just can't wrap my fingers around it. I count the biggest victory of this week is managing to stay focused and trying my hardest to understand.
