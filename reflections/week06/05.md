week 6 went very well! I believe I learned a lot, I feel like i'm having a better grasp on vue. I love the props and components aspect in vue. It feels like apps can be build out with more effeminacy, i'm very happy that were going to be using vue till the end of the course... I can't wait to see how much we'll be advancing in vue.s
